Hi there!

A short intro before we talk. I am Bidyudipta Chanda, better called by (as you have already noticed from the website) Bidyut or Bidyudipta. A little exercise for you to know my age? (I was born in 1996.) Almost all you guys know the place I come from; Kolkata, India and yes, I am a Bengali. Right now, I am working as an IT consultant at an MNC from Bangalore. When I am not in office and not busy reading or being on Netflix, I create those what you just saw on the main page. Enough technology on that page and enough About Me. What about you? I want to know you what is going on in your mind.
