## About the Project
When I started knowing more about Deep Learning and had gone through sufficient number of blog posts stating their own learning paths for this specific area, a man called Jeremy Howard popped up quite a number of times and how he and Rachel Thomas made a practical DL course using their own library, [FastAI](https://fast.ai). Now, many of the readers here would have suggested me otherwise as many of the blog posts did, to start (obviously) with Andrew Ng's **deeplearning.ai** specialization. But being a more getting-my-hands-dirty-and-learning-on-the-field type of person, I chose the former to start with. Do not get me wrong, I will soon be shifting to Ng's Coursera specialization, almost the Bible of DL at present. But, FastAI is something, and which I liked the most, that does not go into nitty-gritties of things, but will provide you with the best possible result. 

**This is my first project based on Convolutional Neural Networks using FastAI and predicts the type of art when inputted with an image, whether it is a painting, a drawing, a sculpture, an iconography or an engraving.**


## Project Details
- The Kaggle notebook for this project to fork is linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bidyutchanda/art-prediction-using-cnn-fastai-acc-94-74).
- The dataset for 5000 images divided into 5 categories is taken from a [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/moosecat/art-images-drawings-painting-sculpture-engraving).
- The Github repo for this can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/bidyutchanda/art-prediction-FastAI).
- Python libraries used extensively are :
    - [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) 
    - [ImageDataBunch](https://docs.fast.ai/vision.data.html#ImageDataBunch) 
    - [cnn_learner](https://docs.fast.ai/vision.learner.html#cnn_learner)
