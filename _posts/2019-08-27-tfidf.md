## About the Project
This is the second workalong project for Machine Learning Course on [Applied AI Course](https://www.appliedaicourse.com).
The entire project is uploaded on Github [at this link](https://github.com/bidyutchanda/tf-idf-vectorizer) and the Jupyter notebook attached to the repo is almost self explanatory.
