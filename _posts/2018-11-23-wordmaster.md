## Story behind this project

First things first, for quite a long time now, my girlfriend and I have been obsessing over languages, words, their histories and roots.

And we found ourselves neck-deep in the search for the meanings of unknown and strange words, reading blogs about the most beautiful words from diverse languages, racking our brains over the mind-boggling stories each of these trace back to (we found the word _komorebi_ exceptionally beautiful, the meaning of which is for you to find out). We would spend hours on Google looking these up and translating them to English and back to their original languages and finding the roots of those words (A subject called etymology, which was an interesting find for me). Now, I will admit that doing these things in 2018 is so much easier than before, say 10 years ago. Translation is not such a pain now thanks to Google Translate and finding its meaning or its etymological roots has never been quicker and easier. But soon I became tired of these long searches for each word and devised something that would make my task easier, the description of which starts below.
