## About the Project
This is the first workalong project for Machine Learning Course on [Applied AI Course](https://www.appliedaicourse.com).
The entire project is uploaded on Github [at this link](https://github.com/bidyutchanda/EDA-Cancer-Dataset) and the Jupyter notebook attached to the repo is almost self explanatory. 

Happy exploring! :)
